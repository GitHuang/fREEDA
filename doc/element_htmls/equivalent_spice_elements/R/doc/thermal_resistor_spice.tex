%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Current characteristics
\underline{\textit{Current characteristics}}:
\newline
\begin{equation}
V_R = R * I_R
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
P = V_R * I_R
\end{equation}
where $P$ is the power dissipated by the resistor.
\newline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Resistance equations
\underline{\textit{Resistance value}}:
\newline
The resistor model consists of process-related device data that
allow the resistance to be calculated from geometric information
and to be corrected for temperature.

The sheet resistance is used with the narrowing parameter and L
and W from the resistor line to determine the nominal resistance
by the formula.
\begin{equation}
R= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll}
            R_0(1+T_{C1}(T-T_{NOM})+T_{C2}(T-T_{NOM})^{2}) & if~R_0~is~specified\\
& \\
            R_{MULTIPLIER}(1+T_{C1}(T-T_{NOM})+T_{C2}(T-T_{NOM})^{2}) & if R_0~is~not~specified \\
             \end{array}
    \right.
\end{equation}
where ~~~R_{MULTIPLIER} = R_{SH}(L-NARROW)/(W-NARROW)
\newline
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\underline{\textit{NOTE}}: \\
It is important to note that the resistor will behave just as a
normal resistor if the parameter ``pdr'' is 0 i.e. the system
temperature will be fixed during the simulation. However, if
``pdr'' is 1, the resistor will function as an electro-thermal
resistor.
