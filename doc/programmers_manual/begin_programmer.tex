%\noindent{\Large\bf Preface}\\[0.5in]
%This book began because of a need for a better \spice\ manual for our
%students who use \spicethree\ in a multi workstation environment
%at the university and on their own IBM-PC compatible computers.
%The great many low-cost \spice manuals that are available are confined to
%just one commercial version of \spice\ (\pspice by Microsim Corporation)
%and simply cause confusion when not used with \pspice.
%Many \spice\ users use several versions of \spice\ and would
%like to know what the common denominator \spice\ syntax is.
%This book is a users manual and reference for three of the most commonly used
%\spice\ programs.  \spicetwo is used as \underline{the} common denominator
%of all \spice\ programs.
%\pspice\ and \spicethree\ extensions of this ``standard'' are clearly
%identified. The book can be used as a reference by the user of any \spice -like
%program provided that the user restricts her or himself to the syntax of
%\spicetwo.
%However personal computer versions of \pspice\ and \spicethree\ are available
%from bulletin boards (or by mail at low cost) although the \spice\ version is
%severely restricted as to the size of circuit which it can handle.
%From the initial effort of developing a universal \spice\ manual,
%and with the feedback from many \spice\ users in university and
%industry, the current manual was developed. The manual has been
%written to support the needs of both novice and experienced users.
%The first part of the book helps users get started with \spice\
%perhaps for the first time. Then the algorithms and methods that
%make \spice\ work are treated. The second part of the book is a
%catalog of \spice\ statements and elements. The element catalog
%presents the electrical models of elements in a detail that has
%not been previously presented in a concise form before with a user
%perspective. An example is the clear explanation of the
%dependencies of the parameters of the MOSFET models. A subject
%that can be particularly confusing otherwise.  Most of the
%electrical models were developed by reverse engineering source
%code as some have not been adequately documented previously. The
%reference section of the manual is well indexed and cross
%referenced making it easy to find desired information with a
%minimum number of indirections.
%We continually strive to improve this manual and welcome your
%suggestions as to its improvement and your corrections.
