Two different forms of initial conditions may be specified  for
some  devices.   The  first  form  is included to
improve the dc convergence for circuits  that  contain  more
than one stable state.  If a device is specified OFF, the dc
operating point is determined with the terminal voltages for
that device set to zero.  After convergence is obtained, the
program continues to iterate to obtain the exact  value  for
the  terminal  voltages.   If a circuit has more than one dc
stable state, the OFF option can be used to force the  solution
to  correspond  to  a  desired  state.  If a device is
specified OFF when in reality the device is conducting,  the
program will still obtain the correct solution (assuming the
solutions converge) but more  iterations  will  be  required
since   the  program  must  independently  converge  to  two
separate solutions.  The .NODESET line serves a similar purpose
as  the  OFF option.  The .NODESET option is easier to
apply and is the preferred means to aid convergence.

The second form of initial conditions are specified for
use  with  the  transient analysis.  These are true 'initial
conditions' as opposed to the convergence aids  above.   See
the  description  of  the  .IC line and the .TRAN line for a
detailed explanation of initial conditions.
