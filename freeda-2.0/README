fREEDA(TM) is a multi physics circuit under development by a user community from universities, communitites and laboratories. It uses state-variables, local reference group concepts and automatic differentiation which allows it to effectively capture multi-physics effects. New model development is also a relatively straightforward process.

fREEDA(TM) can be downloaded at http://www.freeda.org

Documentation
-------------
It can be found in freeda-<version-number>/doc

Developers
----------
fREEDA has evolved because of the work of many people. Below is a list of people, many of whom are still actively involved. Please email Nikhil Kriplani at nkriplani@ncsu.edu to become a developer or if your name may have been mistakenly left out.

Adding a new element
--------------------
A new element contains a ElementName.cc and ElementName.h file. To read more about how to create an element, read the fREEDA programmer's manual in the doc directory.

Once the element is created, add the element to fREEDA by doing the following:
- Create a directory structure under the fREEDA-<version-number>/simulator/elements directory. For example, if you write name your model "Capacitor", you would create a Capacitor directory inside fREEDA-<version-number>/simulator/elements/c.

This Capacitor directory should contain 4 sub-directories:
i) src - which will contain the Capacitor.cc and Capacitor.h files you have just created
ii) bitmap - which will contain a 32x32 pixel png image of the capacitor that goes into the GUI
iii) doc - Documentation for your capacitor element detailing the theory of your element, its usage in a netlist, and simulation results using this element
iv) history - this folder contains previous versions of your element in case you are updating your device model with new code and want to keep a copy of your previous versions.

- In fREEDA-<version-number>/simulator/elements, edit a file called makefile.list. You will add two lines to makefile.list. The first line point fREEDA to the .cc file, while the second line points fREEDA to the name of the element. See the already existing entries of that and follow that format.
 
- Go to fREEDA-<version-number>/simulator, type "make dep". Then type "make". 

- Your element file will be compiled again and the fREEDA binary file  will be re-built, after which you can use your new element in a netlist.

- To add this element to the fREEDA GUI (ifreeda), see the file README_GUI.
