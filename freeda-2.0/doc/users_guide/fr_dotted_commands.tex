\section{Structure of a fREEDA Netlist}

There are four types of elements used in TRANSIM: \footnote{
element: a model of a physical component of a network.} nodes,
edges, edge coupling groups (ECGs) and node coupling groups
(NCGs).  Within those broad classifications there are a wide
variety of individual element types, for example, ``mlin''
(microstrip line), ``coax'' (coaxial cable), and ``idealj'' (ideal
junction).  ``element'' and ``model'' are used synonomously.

\subsection{Lexical Rules}

A lexical rule defines an identifiable object in the input file.
That is it defines the equivalent of words.  Words put togetehr in
a particular order define a grammar. fREEDA recognizes many "words"
but the important one are as follows.

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf whitespace}& a blank\\
                &  a newline followed immediately by a + sign.\\
                &  a tab\\
                &  a vertical tab\\
                &  a newpage
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf identifier} & A character sequence beginning with an
alphabetic character \[A-Za-z\]
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf variables} & A variable must begin with an alphabetic
character or a \$
                followed by alphanumeric characters or `\_' or
                `.'\\
                & Example: \\
                & \indent {\tt HEIGHT}\\
                & \indent {\tt \$height}\\
                & \indent {\tt height.1\_1}\\
                & Note that {\tt HEIGHT} and {\tt height} are identical as
                case is not preserved.
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf strings} & Either as an identifier (a continuous sequence of
alphanumeric characters) or enclosed within double quotes. \\
               &The following special escaped characters are allowed in
               strings defined within double quotes.\\
                & {\tt " } To include a double quote in a string.\\
                & {\tt $\backslash$n } To indicate a newline \\
               & Examples:\\
               & \indent {\tt gate}\\
               & \indent {\tt "VOLTAGE WAVEFORM"}\\
               & Note: Strings may continue across lines using the
               continuation syntax:\\
               & {\tt "VOLTAGE}\\
               & {\tt + WAVEFORM"}\\
               & or simply by continuing across a line as in\\
               & {\tt "VOLTAGE}\\
               & {\tt WAVEFORM"}
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf numbers}] & ``E'' or ``e'' to indicate exponent.
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf dotted command} & A ``.'' followed by alphabetic characters
at the beginning of a line.
\end{tabular}

\begin{tabular}{p{1.5in}p{3in}}
{\bf lf}& A line feed or carriage return.
\end{tabular}

\subsubsection{Capitalization}

The case of identifiers and keywords is ignored in TRANSIM
netlists. The significance of case is retained only within quoted
strings, and in that case it is always retained. Internally
characters are mapped to lower case.

\clearpage
\section{SPICE Elements}

All regular SPICE elements have the same syntax as in standard
SPICE but with the following additions.
\begin{enumerate}
\item A {\tt .model} specification is allowed for all elements.
\item Anything that can appear in a {\tt .model} specification can be
      included in the specification of the element.
\item If a parameter is not specified either through an  element
specification or a {\tt.model} specification then the default
parameters for that model will apply to this element.
\end{enumerate}

{\tt <term\_id>} is either an integer or a string in double
quotes, and is the name of a terminal in the network.  {\tt
<term\_id\_list>} is a list of one or more terminal id's separated
by white space.

\section{General File Comments}
The first line of an input file is used as the identifier string
and is associated with various output files to identify their
origin. It is seen strictly as a text string and no processing is
done on it. If a particular statement won't fit on a single line,
it may be continued by placing a ``+'' at the beginning of each
additional line.  All comments are proceeded by an ``*'' (an
asterisk) and there is no limit to the number of comment lines
used in a file. A comment may begin anywhere on a line (such as
after a statement) and any text after the asterisk is ignored by
the parser.

\section{Element Instance Syntax}

Each instance of an element in TRANSIM netlist is declared in the
same manner with each declaration existing on a separate line.
The syntax is:
\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
        element:instance_id term1 term2....  model = "identifier"
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}
The terms {\em element} and {\em identifier} are the same as those
used in the description of the {\em .model} statement and {\em
instance\_id} is a unique string that identifies this instance of
{\em identifier}. {\em term1}, {\em term2}, etc. are the terminal
specifiers which maybe a string or numeric values.

\section{Netlist Variables}

Local variables for use inside a netlist may be set with the {\em
.options} command using the same syntax as used to set system
variables.  For example

\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
                      .options logic1 = 5.0
                      .options logic0 = 0.6
                      .options  vdiff = logic1 - logic2
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}

These local variables do not need to be declared before being set
but they must be set before being used.  Local variables are
designed so that common parameters (such as microstrip width) may
be declared in each {\em .model} statement as a variable with the
variables value set once at the top of the netlist.  Changing
width requires changing one variable rather than multiple
declarations in different {\em .model} statements. The third {\em
.options} statement above illustrates the use of mathematical
operations on local variables, in this case the difference between
{\bf logic1} and {\bf logic0} is assigned to {\bf vdiff}. Various
analyses rely on variables set in a {\em .options} statement.  The
variables are defined in the description of the particular
analyses.

\section{.couple  --- Couple Elements}

{\em NOT FUNCTIONAL in current version}
\noindent\textit{Form:}
\newline
{\tt .couple $\langle$ \tt{element\ instance\ name}$\rangle$ ... $\langle$
\tt{element\ instance\ name}$\rangle$ $\langle$ \tt{terminal\
name}$\rangle$ $\langle$ \tt{terminal\ name}$\rangle$}\\[0.2in]
\newline
\textit{Description:}\\
.couple is used to identify the elements that combine to create a coupled element.\\[0.2in]

This command is used to indicate which edges (or nodes) to be
simulated as coupled lines.  The syntax is:
\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
                 .couple line_1 line_2 line_3....
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}
where {\em line\_1} etc. are the specific names given to each
instance of a line (or node).  Note that the type of model used
for coupled edges or nodes must be able to handle coupling.  In
general, a single line or node that may also be coupled is just a
subset of the coupled line case.  In other words, if a coupled
line model (such as {\bf cmlin}) is specified as the line model
and the {\em .couple} statement is not used, then the simulator
will default to using the uncoupled model (in this case {\bf
mlin}).  This is not a runtime option but is fixed inside the code
modules for each model.

\clearpage
\subsection{.locate --- Identify Location of Terminals}

This command is used to define the physical location or a terminal.  These cartesian
coordinates refer to the locations of the ``logical'' terminals of
the device.  The units are meters.  The syntax is:
\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
                       .locate term x y
                       .locate term x y z
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}
where {\tt term} is one of the terminals of a device in the
netlist and {\tt x}, {\tt y} and {\tt z} (if provided) are the
coordinates of that terminal. Be default {\tt z}=0.

\clearpage
\section{.model}

\noindent
\textit{Description:}\\
.model is used to identify the elements that combine to create a coupled element.\\[0.2in]

The syntax of the {\em .model} statement is:

\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
              .model identifier element (par1 par2 ...)
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}
\begin{itemize}
\item({\em identifier}) is any character string name assigned by the user
by which this particular model will be referred.
\item({\em model\_type}) is the model name as defined in the .c file associated
with this model and as declared in pd\_physdef.c.
\item(par1 par2...) is the parameter list.
\end{itemize}

The {\em .model} statement must be used before it is referred to in the netlist.  All fREEDA elements can utilize a {\em .model} statement.

\clearpage
\section{.options}

\noindent
\textit{Description:}\\
.options is used to identify the elements that combine to create a coupled element.\\[0.2in]

This command allows various runtime options and user defined
netlist variables to be set prior to execution.  The various
system options will be discussed later in this appendix but the
general syntax is:
\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
                .options variable = value
                .options variable = "string"
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}

The first case is used for assigning a numeric value to a variable
and the second is used to assign a string.  Note that double quote
marks (``...'') must be used to surround the string.  Not
typecasting of numeric variables is performed in the .options
command and thus no distinction is made between floating point and
integer values. Therefore 2 is the same as 2.00 until the value is
actually used in the simulator.  Exponential notation is denoted
by the ``e'' operator (i.e. 0.001 = 1.0e-3). Note that string
variables may contain any symbols but must be continuous with no
white space between characters (i.e. ``V\_high'' not ``V high'').

\section{.out}
\noindent\textit{Form:}\\
{\tt .out write ( [[$<${\it qualifier}$>$] $<${\it value}$>$*]
$<${\it operator}$>$ )*
      in $<${\it filename}$>$} \\
This write what is left on the stack into the file {\it filename}
or \\
{\tt .out system ( [[<{\it qualifier}$>$] <{\it value}$>$*] [<{\it
operator}$>$] )* } This performs a system call of the string
equivalent of whatever is left on
the stack.  \\
\newline
{\tt .out $\langle$ \tt{terminal\ name}$\rangle$ $\langle$
\tt{terminal\ name}$\rangle$ $\langle$ \tt{terminal\
name}$\rangle$ $\langle$ \tt{terminal\ name}$\rangle$}\\[0.2in]
\newline
\textit{Description:}\\
.out is used to identify the elements that combine to create a coupled element.\\[0.2in]

The {\em .out} command is used to process and output data
resulting from a fREEDA run.  The {\em .out} statement uses stacks
and has a syntax much like a reverse polish notation calculator.
It is a powerful output engine and can be utilized in its own
right or in conjunction with the more usual {\em .print} and {\em
.plot} statements although these provide much less functionality.
A variety of signal processing functions including arithmetic
operators may be used to manipulate the data prior to writing it
to a file, plotting to the screen or piping it to a system call.

fREEDA has an interpretive output language which uses a reverse
polish syntax. The operators operate on a stack and as an
operation is performed zero or more arguments are consumed by an
operator.

Details of the various options will be shown at the end of this
section but for most situations and netlists, the voltages and
currents at the various external ports are to be written to output
files in standard ASCII format. An example is shown below:

\begin{tt}
\begin{verbatim}
                 .out write term 1 vt in "1v.out"
                 .out write term 2 it in "2i.out"
\end{verbatim}
\end{tt}

In the first example, the voltage at terminal 1 is written out to
file ``1v.out''.  The second example writes the current going {\em
into} terminal 2 to the file ``2i.out''.
